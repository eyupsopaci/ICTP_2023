# ICTP_2023
Tutorial for Workshop on Mechanics of the Earthquake Cycle | (smr 3885), Trieste, ITALY
The tutorials  simulate earthquake cycles (seismic and aseismic slip on tectonic faults) under the quasi-dynamic approximation (quasi-static elasticity combined with radiation damping) on faults governed by rate-and-state friction and embedded in elastic media. For this purpose, we use QDYN Fortran code with Python wrapper https://ydluo.github.io/qdyn/. 
The necessary compilation steps for the code are found in the 'wrapper.odp' file.
The tutorial files are in the Jupyter Notebook files.
